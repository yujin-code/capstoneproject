This is my first capstone project done with my teammates Lilin and Swee Meng
Brazil recorded the first case of SARS-CoV-2 on February 26, and since then the virus transmission evolved from imported cases only to local and finally community transmission very rapidly.

One of the motivations for this challenge is the fact that in the context of an overwhelmed health system with the possible limitation to perform tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, testing every case would be impractical and tests results could be delayed even if only a target subpopulation would be tested.

So the hospital is sharing the data with commmunity thru Kaggle to find a solutions the problem

One possible approach is to increase the effectiveness of recommending ICU to only those patients who meets the criteria after their laboratory test results, and also based on the severity of illness,  placed those patient accordingly to different wards (regular, semiâ€“intensive unit, Intensive care unit)

Objective

Based on the results of laboratory tests commonly collected among confirmed COVID-19 cases during a visit to the emergency room, , we seek to predict which patients will need to be admitted to a regular ward, semi-intensive unit, or intensive care unit.

The dataset contains 109 variables (predictors), a Patient ID and one target outcome variable, which indicates whether the patient tested positive/negative for SARS-Cov-2. There are 5644 samples available with 558 positive cases, which constitutes 10% of the dataset.
